# 🗺️ 12-Week Learning Roadmap for Enterprise NLP Engineer

This roadmap is tailored for someone who already understands classical ML, DL, surface-level LLMs, RAG, Model Context Protocol, and has deep knowledge of LLM architecture.

---

## 📅 Week 1–2: Enterprise NLP Mindset & Systems Thinking

**📘 Materials:**
- AI System Design Patterns (human-in-loop, cascading models, retrieval-augmented pipelines)

**🧪 Practice:**
- Create a mindmap for a real-world use case: *“LLM for legal/medical/financial services”*
- Identify system components: input, preprocessing, retriever, reranker, LLM, post-processing

---

## 📅 Week 3–4: Advanced NLP & Long-Context Transformers

**📘 Materials:**
- Research papers: FlashAttention, Performer, Reformer
- [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)
- Self-supervised learning techniques: Masked LM, ELECTRA, contrastive learning

**🧪 Practice:**
- Benchmark token limits of local LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2 7B vs Mistral)
- Implement FlashAttention vs regular attention in PyTorch
- Summarize a research paper like BioBERT or LegalBERT

---

## 📅 Week 5–6: LLM Optimization & Finetuning (LoRA, QLoRA, MoE)

**📘 Materials:**
- Hugging Face PEFT (LoRA, QLoRA)
- Quantization techniques: GPTQ, SmoothQuant
- Paper: Mixtral (Mixture of Experts)

**🧪 Practice:**
- Finetune LLaMA/Mistral using QLoRA on a small dataset (e.g., Indonesian FAQs, legal Q&A)
- Compare inference latency of original vs GPTQ-quantized models
- Deploy the model via vLLM or TGI (Text Generation Inference)

---

## 📅 Week 7–8: Enterprise-Ready RAG Pipeline

**📘 Materials:**
- Hybrid search techniques (BM25 + dense)
- Paper: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP
- Vector databases: Qdrant, Weaviate

**🧪 Practice:**
- Build a RAG system using Haystack or LangChain + Qdrant
- Optimize rerankers (e.g., BGE-m3 vs SPLADE)
- Add metadata filters & chunking strategy

---

## 📅 Week 9–10: Model Serving, Guardrails, and Observability

**📘 Materials:**
- Model serving with Ray Serve or BentoML
- Prompt injection defense & output filtering
- Monitoring tools: PromptLayer, Langfuse

**🧪 Practice:**
- Build a REST API for an LLM-based chat assistant
- Integrate input toxicity detection (e.g., Detoxify)
- Implement logging, response tracing, and result evaluation (PromptLayer/Langfuse)

---

## 📅 Week 11–12: Evaluation, Agent Frameworks, and Final Project

**📘 Materials:**
- LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks: G-Eval, TruLens, Promptfoo
- LangGraph for agentic memory and flow
- Customizing LLMs for legal, health, and financial domains

**🧪 Practice:**
- Build an **LLM Agent** using LangGraph or CrewAI for long-document QA
- Deploy the project on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Sharing
- Write a technical article on Medium or LinkedIn documenting your solution

---

## 🎓 Final Outcome After 12 Weeks

✅ Deep understanding of enterprise-level NLP systems  
✅ 1–2 working NLP product demos  
✅ Hands-on experience with optimization, deployment, observability, and evaluation  
✅ Ready for industry roles like NLP AI Engineer or LLM System Architect
